# Schreiberling

Schreiberling is a distraction free markdown editor made to write without being annoyed of things that are in the way while you're typing. It uses a two column design: One column for the text you are writing and one column as a rendered preview of your text.

Schreiberling gives you a clear writing feeling. It feels like writing on a white piece of paper when writing on Schreiberling's white interface. When writing with Schreiberling, there is nothing more than you, your text and a very nice and clean interface with a menu bar at the top.

Everything in Schreiberling can be customized. You like line numbers? Activate them! You don't want to have a menu bar? Disable it! You normally do all and everything with shortcuts? No problem! And if there is anything, Schreiberling can't do, feel free to code it yourself. Schreiberling runs modern web languages like HTML and Javascript and is completely open source. It comes with a nice plugin API to write your own plugins - and if that is not enough: Just help us to make Schreiberling better! Get yourself the source code, code a new feature and use and share it as you want - or just send it back to us so we can implementate it into Schreiberling.

All features of Schreiberling in one list:

* Distraction free writing
* Completely customizable
* Plugin API
* Open Source

Yes - it is not more. But ask yourself: Do you really need more? We do not and that's what Schreiberling is: All you need.

## Technical stuff

Schreiberling is in an early alpha stage. It may not work 100% correctly, it may crash and it may damage files. I am NOT liable for any damages that may occur as it is written in the license that comes with Schreiberling.
You are free to download it and to test it. I thank you for every bug and issue you report.
